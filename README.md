# 🎮 Memory Game

    Hi there! Welcome to my **Memory Game**. This is a project I decided to work on when I was feeling a bit bored, and it turned out to be quite a fun experience. It's a classic memory game with a modern and colorful twist.

    ## 🚀 Project Description

    The Memory Game is a two-player game where you compete to find all the matching pairs of cards. Each player can customize their name and color before starting. The goal is simple: find more pairs than your opponent!

    ## 🕹️ How to Play

    1. **Game Start**: 
       - Enter your name and choose a color for your player.
       - Click "Start Game" to begin.

    2. **Game Rules**:
       - Cards are laid out face down in a grid.
       - Players take turns flipping two cards.
       - If the cards match, the player keeps them and takes another turn.
       - If they don't match, the cards are flipped back over.
       - The game ends when all pairs are found.
       - The player with the most pairs at the end wins.

    ## 🎨 Features

    - **Attractive Interface**: Modern and colorful design with smooth animations.
    - **Customization**: Players can choose their names and colors.
    - **Responsive**: The card grid adapts to different screen sizes.
    - **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless transition from the start screen to the game.

    ## 🛠️ Technologies Used

    - **React**: I used React to efficiently build the user interface. React allows me to create reusable components and manage the game state easily.
    - **Vite**: I chose Vite as the development tool because it's incredibly fast and easy to set up. It helped me focus on development without worrying about complex configurations.
    - **CSS**: The styles are crafted with pure CSS, which allowed me to fully customize the game's design and animations.
